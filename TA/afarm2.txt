1. Consumer behavior over time
The model demonstrates stable consumption dynamics. Agents strive to cover the deficit in important categories within the available budget. The distribution of expenses shows patterns:
• regular spending on basic categories (e.g. food, health);
• growth of savings after receiving a salary (once every 15 days) and a subsequent surge in spending;
• transition from purchases "out of need" to stable patterns (frequency of spending in key categories).
The graph of wealth changes shows a sawtooth structure - alternation of savings and spending of capital. This indicates saving and accumulation in periods between income receipts.
2. Purchase strategy
Thanks to the use of linear programming, the model makes purchases rationally: at each point in time, up to five of the most relevant categories are selected according to the integral criterion (taking into account deficit, importance and predictability):
• categories with high priority and rapid depletion of stocks are purchased first;
• less important categories remain unfunded under a limited budget;
• purchases are scaled taking into account prices on the current date and logistical constraints.
If it is impossible to find an optimal solution — for example, with a very low budget — the agent makes a fallback purchase for the most important category, using up to 10% of the remaining funds.
3. Social influence
If a graph of connections between agents is specified, the model demonstrates the effect of priority adaptation: importance weights are recalculated taking into account the average behavior of neighbors (once a week). This leads to a convergence of agent preferences in a group and can form quasi-markets or local trends in consumption.
4. Geography and logistics
The model provides the ability to specify agent coordinates, which allows taking into account spatial constraints. In the experimental implementation, they are used as a potential basis for calculating logistical costs, which is important for further development of the model towards regional analysis or transport infrastructure modeling.
5. General patterns
• Categories with high predictability (for example, utilities or mandatory expenses) are stably financed, even with a limited budget.
• The importance function allows avoiding excessive spending on categories with low importance.
• Introducing restrictions on the number of simultaneously financed categories (no more than 5) leads to more realistic consumer choice, avoiding budget dispersion.
